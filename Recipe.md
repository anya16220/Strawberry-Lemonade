PREP WORK
Make Simple Syrup - Boil water & add the sugar to it. Stir continuously to dissolve the sugar and take it off the heat. Allow this mixture to cool. Simple sugar syrup is ready. 

This can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 weeks easily. Comes in really handy like when you have to make this drink.

Make Strawberry Puree - Hull the strawberries (cut the green part off) & then puree them in a blender without water or sugar to give 1 cup puree.

Squeeze Lemon Juice - Cut the lemons in half & squeeze the lemon juice to give about 1 cup of lemon juice. The number of lemons may vary based on their size and how juicy they are.

TO MAKE THE STRAWBERRY LEMONADE CONCENTRATE
Strain the strawberry puree and lemon juice in to jug or jar. To it add simple syrup and salt give it a good mix.

Store the concentrate in a bottle/jar & refrigerate till use. Add the lemon slices to the concentrate for more citrusy flavor.

STORAGE AND SERVING
The concentrate will keep good for up to a week or two. Store it in a sealed jar or bottle and keep it chilled in the fridge.

You can serve strawberry lemonade with cold water or with a bubbly drink like soda or sparkling water or a mix of both. The fizz adds an extra zing to this drink. 

Option 1 - Individual serving - Add some ice cubes to your glass followed by concentrate (approx half of your glass) & remaining half with chilled Soda/Water. Give it a good mix and enjoy it!!

Optional - The lemonade is ready to serve as is but adding some mint, lemon, and strawberry slices to your lemonade makes it extra special!!

Option 2 - Big Batch - If you are making this for a large gathering then mix everything into a pitcher and serve.

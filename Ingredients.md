1. Sweetener/Sugar Syrup- I prefer using homemade simple Syrup made by boiling equal parts of water and sugar (1:1). Honey, agave, or maple syrup can be used but they alter the taste.

2. Lemon juice: I use freshly squeezed lemon juice. This effort is worth it.

3. Strawberry Puree: I like to use fresh strawberries and puree them without water or sugar.

4. Salt: A little salt helps to really bring out the flavors.

5. For serving: Sparkling water or Club soda- I like to mix the concentrate with soda so it has a gentle sparkle to it. Water can be used too.

6. Garnishes - Mint leaves, lemon slices, and strawberry slices.
